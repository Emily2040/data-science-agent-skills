## Summary

`missingness-mechanism-investigator` is an independent Agent/Codex skill for: Diagnose missing-data mechanisms and design imputation, exclusion, or sensitivity plans.

It exists because Missing values are filled or dropped mechanically, creating bias and false confidence. MCAR, MAR, and MNAR require different assumptions; the skill forces mechanism thinking before imputation.

The skill is not a generic data-analysis helper. It is a judgment workflow: it tells the agent what evidence to gather, what checks to run, what assumptions to expose, and what decision-ready artifact to return.

## Problem It Solves

The current data science pain is not that there are no notebooks, dashboards, profilers, or MLOps tools. The pain is that teams still lose trust at the handoff points: unclear questions, weak data readiness, hidden leakage, missing provenance, fragile notebooks, vague ownership, and model work that cannot be defended.

This skill targets one of those gaps directly:

- Primary pain: Missing values are filled or dropped mechanically, creating bias and false confidence.
- Why existing tools are not enough: tools can inspect fragments, but they rarely force the agent to connect evidence, owner decisions, risk, and next action in one repeatable workflow.
- What this skill adds: MCAR, MAR, and MNAR require different assumptions; the skill forces mechanism thinking before imputation.

## What This Skill Should Do

- Convert the request into an explicit Missingness Mechanism Investigator decision rather than a loose analysis task.
- List the evidence used, the evidence missing, and the assumptions that are driving the recommendation.
- Run the skill workflow against local artifacts when available: dataset, analysis goal, column meanings, collection process.
- Separate mechanical checks from judgment calls so another reviewer can audit the result.
- Return a decision-ready artifact with risks, owner questions, and the smallest next action.
- Refuse to hide uncertainty. Mark unknown, not applicable, and needs human owner review as separate states.

## Required Inputs

- dataset
- analysis goal
- column meanings
- collection process
- known reasons for missingness

If an input is missing, the agent should inspect local files, schemas, notebooks, configs, or reports first. It should ask the user only for information that cannot be recovered and would materially change the decision.

## Operating Workflow

1. Profile missingness by column, row, group, time, and target relationship.
2. Classify likely mechanisms as MCAR, MAR, MNAR, structural missing, or unknown.
3. Identify whether missingness itself should be a feature, exclusion reason, or bias warning.
4. Recommend complete-case, imputation, indicator, model-based, or sensitivity strategy.
5. Return a missingness report with assumptions and impact on claims.

## Expected Outputs

- missingness heat map summary
- mechanism labels
- imputation plan
- sensitivity plan
- claim limitations

Every final answer produced with this skill should use this output contract:

- `Problem`: the decision, artifact, model, data source, or workflow being handled.
- `Inputs`: files, data, stakeholder context, assumptions, and missing context used.
- `Checks performed`: concrete inspections, scripts, and reasoning checks.
- `Findings`: prioritized observations with evidence.
- `Decision`: go, fix-first, stop, proceed-with-risk, or needs-owner-review.
- `Risks`: unresolved blockers, caveats, and owner decisions.
- `Next actions`: the smallest useful follow-up steps.
- `Artifacts`: generated files, specs, scripts, reports, or links.

## Concrete Use Cases

- Before a project starts: decide whether to proceed with missingness mechanism investigator work or fix prerequisites first.
- During review: challenge the work when a red flag appears, such as target-dependent missingness.
- Before handoff: package the findings so another agent, data scientist, engineer, or stakeholder can act without rereading the whole investigation.

## Red Flags

- target-dependent missingness
- structural missing treated as random
- imputed identifiers
- dropped rows change population
- no collection-process explanation

When one of these appears, the skill should slow down, preserve evidence, and name the risk in the final decision. A red flag does not always mean stop, but it must be visible.

## How To Use With OpenAI Agents

Copy this whole folder into the configured skills directory. Invoke it with `$missingness-mechanism-investigator` or let the frontmatter description trigger it. Keep `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` beside `SKILL.md`.

For Codex, use it when the task involves local evidence, file inspection, validation, implementation planning, or PR-ready artifacts. The helper scripts should run only against local files or explicit user-provided data.

## How To Use With Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, LangGraph, CrewAI, Or AutoGen

Use `SKILL.md` as the role instruction for a specialist agent. Attach `references/playbook.md` for the checklist, `references/acceptance-tests.md` for forward tests, and `references/provider-interop.md` for provider-specific adaptation.

For multi-agent systems, route this skill as a specialist reviewer. It should receive evidence from collector agents, run local scripts where available, then return a decision artifact rather than unstructured advice.

## Data Providers And Platforms

Use exported metadata, schemas, samples, logs, lineage files, model cards, metric reports, or experiment records from Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, dbt, Dagster, MLflow, DVC, W&B, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, or local files.

Do not upload private data to external providers unless the user explicitly approves that environment. Provider output is evidence, not authority.

## Included Files

- `SKILL.md`: trigger metadata and core execution workflow.
- `README.md`: this independent GitHub skill page.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: OpenAI-facing metadata and invocation defaults.
- `.gitignore`: local noise filter for this skill.
- `references/playbook.md`: skill-specific checklist, decisions, red flags, and evidence discipline.
- `references/acceptance-tests.md`: clean, messy, and adversarial forward tests.
- `references/evidence-map.md`: public evidence and non-duplication rationale.
- `references/infographic-spec.md`: social visual brief.
- `references/provider-interop.md`: provider and agent usage guide.
- `scripts/`: deterministic local helper scripts where this skill benefits from checks.
- `assets/hero-shot.png`: 1600x900 hero image.
- `assets/reddit-infographic.png`: 1080x1350 Reddit-ready infographic.

## Validation

Run `python scripts/quick_validate_skill.py .` inside this folder. For script-backed skills, run the relevant helper script on a tiny local fixture and one messy example.

Before merging or installing the skill, verify:

- The README renders both images at the top.
- `SKILL.md` has the correct trigger name and output contract.
- The helper scripts return clear errors for missing or invalid inputs.
- The skill does not silently mutate raw data.
- The final response names assumptions and next actions.
