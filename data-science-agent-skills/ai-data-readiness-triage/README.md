## Executive Summary

**AI Data Readiness Triage** is a portable, provider-neutral data science agent skill designed to assess whether a dataset or data domain is ready for AI, analytics, or modeling before a project commits time and budget.

> **Core pain solved:** AI projects stall because access, freshness, quality, lineage, privacy, labels, and ownership are discovered too late.

> **Proof callout:** Turns AI optimism into a concrete go or fix-first call.

## Research-Informed Design Standard

This skill follows reproducible data science and portable agent-skill standards:

- **Cookiecutter Data Science**: immutable raw data, clear artifact layout, and repeatable command entrypoints.
- **Kedro**: explicit input/output data contracts and modular workflow boundaries.
- **MLflow**: traceable parameters, metrics, provenance hashes, and governance-ready evaluation records.
- **Anthropic & Open Agent Skills**: concise `SKILL.md` frontmatter, progressive disclosure via `references/`, and deterministic local scripts in `scripts/`.
- **CfRR Reproducible Research**: deterministic verification, explicit uncertainty, and zero hidden state.

## Problem It Solves

AI projects stall because access, freshness, quality, lineage, privacy, labels, and ownership are discovered too late. Without a structured gate, teams routinely discover `unknown owner` or `no label source` only after engineering effort or executive credibility has already been spent.

## What This Skill Should Do

- Transform a vague request into an explicit AI Data Readiness Triage decision with named owner, evidence, assumptions, and action threshold.
- Inspect local artifacts first: data extracts, schemas, notebooks, SQL, pipeline configs, model reports, tickets, and prior decisions.
- Separate mechanical checks from expert judgment so another reviewer can reproduce what was checked and what was inferred.
- Classify findings as stop, fix-first, monitor, accepted risk, or owner decision instead of producing generic advice.
- Preserve raw evidence and never silently mutate data, notebooks, model artifacts, or production configs.
- Return a decision artifact that can be handed to a data scientist, ML engineer, governance reviewer, or stakeholder without hidden context.

## Required Inputs

- dataset paths or schemas
- data owner
- intended use case
- privacy or compliance constraints
- label or ground-truth plan

## Operating Workflow

1. Inventory access, ownership, lineage, refresh cadence, privacy, and retention constraints.
2. Profile quality, missingness, duplication, outliers, type drift, and label coverage.
3. Score readiness across governance, quality, representativeness, reproducibility, and operational fit.
4. Classify blockers as stop, fix-first, monitor, or accepted risk.
5. Return a readiness scorecard with the smallest credible next action.

## Expected Outputs

- readiness scorecard
- blocker register
- minimum remediation plan
- label and privacy notes
- go/no-go recommendation

All outputs are delivered inside the eight-section decision contract: `Problem`, `Inputs`, `Checks performed`, `Findings`, `Decision`, `Risks`, `Next actions`, and `Artifacts`.

## Concrete Use Cases

- **Pre-commit readiness gate**: Run `scripts/profile_table.py` on `dataset paths or schemas` to produce a `readiness scorecard` before approving engineering scope.
- **Adversarial review**: Challenge a proposed `go` recommendation when `unknown owner` or `no label source` is suspected in `data owner`.
- **Cross-team handoff**: Generate `blocker register` and `go/no-go recommendation` so ML engineers, governance reviewers, or downstream agents can act without re-running discovery.
- **Regression audit**: Score completed review checklists with `scripts/checklist_score.py --strict` inside CI to prevent unverified artifacts from shipping.

## Red Flags

- unknown owner
- no label source
- PII without approved use
- high missingness in core fields
- freshness mismatched to decision cycle

## Agent And Provider Portability

- **Agent Runtimes**: OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT Agents, Anthropic Claude, Claude Code, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Goose, OpenCode, OpenHands, Gravity, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, and local LLM agents.
- **Data & ML Providers**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, dbt, Dagster, Airflow, Prefect, MLflow, DVC, Weights & Biases, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, Great Expectations, Pandera, Evidently, Kedro, and local CSV/Parquet/JSON files.
