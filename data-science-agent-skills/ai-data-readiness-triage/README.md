# AI Data Readiness Triage

![Hero shot](assets/hero-shot.png)

## What This Skill Solves

Assess whether a dataset or data domain is ready for AI, analytics, or modeling before a project commits time and budget.

Pain point: AI projects stall because access, freshness, quality, lineage, privacy, labels, and ownership are discovered too late.

Why it matters: Readiness scoring gives leaders a hard go, fix-first, or stop decision instead of optimistic prototype theater.

## When To Use It

Use `$ai-data-readiness-triage` when the task is to assess whether a dataset or data domain is ready for AI, analytics, or modeling before a project commits time and budget. It is built for judgment-heavy work where the agent must inspect evidence, name assumptions, and produce a decision-ready artifact.

## When Not To Use It

- Do not use this skill for generic spreadsheet editing, chart styling, or file conversion unless the data science decision workflow is the main task.
- Do not use it as a substitute for legal, medical, financial, or compliance approval.
- Do not use helper scripts as proof by themselves; scripts provide evidence checks, not full expert judgment.

## Inputs

- dataset paths or schemas
- data owner
- intended use case
- privacy or compliance constraints
- label or ground-truth plan

## Workflow

1. Inventory access, ownership, lineage, refresh cadence, privacy, and retention constraints.
2. Profile quality, missingness, duplication, outliers, type drift, and label coverage.
3. Score readiness across governance, quality, representativeness, reproducibility, and operational fit.
4. Classify blockers as stop, fix-first, monitor, or accepted risk.
5. Return a readiness scorecard with the smallest credible next action.

## Outputs

- readiness scorecard
- blocker register
- minimum remediation plan
- label and privacy notes
- go/no-go recommendation

Every final response should include: Problem, Inputs, Checks performed, Findings, Decision, Risks, Next actions, and Artifacts.

## Use With Other Agents And Providers

![Infographic](assets/reddit-infographic.png)

### OpenAI Codex Or ChatGPT Agents

Copy this whole folder into the configured skills directory. Invoke it with `$ai-data-readiness-triage` or let the frontmatter description trigger it. Keep `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` beside `SKILL.md`.

### Anthropic Claude Skills

Use manual adaptation unless the host supports multi-file skill folders directly. Use `SKILL.md` as the primary skill instruction. Keep `references/playbook.md` and `references/acceptance-tests.md` attached as supporting resources when possible.

### Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, And IDE Agents

Use manual adaptation. Attach `SKILL.md` as the task rule. Attach `references/playbook.md` for review or implementation work, and run helper scripts locally when file evidence is available.

### LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, And Custom Runtimes

Use manual adaptation. Treat this folder as a specialist-agent role pack. Expose scripts in `scripts/` as local tools and route results through the standard output contract.

### Data Providers And Platforms

Use local exports or metadata from Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, dbt, Dagster, MLflow, DVC, W&B, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, or local files. Do not upload private data to external providers unless the user explicitly approves that environment.

## Included Files

- `SKILL.md`: trigger metadata and core workflow.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: OpenAI UI metadata and invocation defaults.
- `.gitignore`: keeps Python bytecode caches and local OS files out of PR payloads.
- `references/playbook.md`: checklist, decision rules, red flags, and evidence discipline.
- `references/acceptance-tests.md`: clean, messy, and adversarial forward tests.
- `references/evidence-map.md`: public evidence and non-duplication rationale.
- `references/infographic-spec.md`: Reddit visual brief.
- `references/provider-interop.md`: provider and agent usage guide.
- `scripts/`: deterministic local helper scripts.
- `assets/hero-shot.png`: wide hero image for PRs and docs.
- `assets/reddit-infographic.png`: 1080x1350 Reddit-ready infographic.

## Helper Scripts

Run scripts locally against explicit user-provided artifacts. They are support checks, not complete replacements for expert review.

- `scripts/quick_validate_skill.py .`: validate this standalone skill folder. Exit `0` means the package is structurally complete.
- `scripts/checklist_score.py checklist.json --strict`: score pass/partial/fail/blocker checklist JSON. Exit nonzero when strict mode finds anything below ready.
- `scripts/profile_table.py data.csv`: profile CSV columns, missingness, uniqueness, numeric ranges, and PII-name hints.

## Red Flags

- unknown owner
- no label source
- PII without approved use
- high missingness in core fields
- freshness mismatched to decision cycle

## Validation

Run `python scripts/quick_validate_skill.py .` inside this folder. For script-backed checks, run the relevant script on local fixture data or user-provided artifacts. Validate the result against `references/acceptance-tests.md`.

## Completeness Checklist

- [x] Independent `SKILL.md` with specific trigger metadata.
- [x] README page with problem, use cases, inputs, workflow, outputs, provider guidance, and validation.
- [x] Provider and multi-agent interoperability guide.
- [x] Skill-specific playbook and acceptance tests.
- [x] Hero shot and Reddit infographic assets.
- [x] Local deterministic helper scripts where useful.
- [x] Explicit red flags and evidence discipline.
