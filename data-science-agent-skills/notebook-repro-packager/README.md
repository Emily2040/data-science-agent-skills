# Notebook Repro Packager

![Hero shot](assets/hero-shot.png)

## What This Skill Solves

Package notebooks so another machine or teammate can reproduce their results with known data, environment, seeds, and order.

Pain point: Notebooks break because execution order, hidden state, local paths, package versions, and data provenance are not captured.

Why it matters: Reproducibility requires a small set of mechanical checks plus a clear run contract.

## When To Use It

Use `$notebook-repro-packager` when the task is to package notebooks so another machine or teammate can reproduce their results with known data, environment, seeds, and order. It is built for judgment-heavy work where the agent must inspect evidence, name assumptions, and produce a decision-ready artifact.

## When Not To Use It

- Do not use this skill for generic spreadsheet editing, chart styling, or file conversion unless the data science decision workflow is the main task.
- Do not use it as a substitute for legal, medical, financial, or compliance approval.
- Do not use helper scripts as proof by themselves; scripts provide evidence checks, not full expert judgment.

## Inputs

- notebook files
- data dependencies
- environment files
- expected outputs
- runtime constraints

## Workflow

1. Audit execution order, hidden state, hard-coded paths, missing seeds, and external dependencies.
2. Capture environment, data manifest, run command, and expected output checks.
3. Separate exploratory cells from required run path.
4. Add smoke-test guidance and failure messages.
5. Return a reproducibility package checklist and patch plan.

## Outputs

- notebook audit
- environment manifest
- data manifest
- run instructions
- smoke-test plan

Every final response should include: Problem, Inputs, Checks performed, Findings, Decision, Risks, Next actions, and Artifacts.

## Use With Other Agents And Providers

![Infographic](assets/reddit-infographic.png)

### OpenAI Codex Or ChatGPT Agents

Copy this whole folder into the configured skills directory. Invoke it with `$notebook-repro-packager` or let the frontmatter description trigger it. Keep `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` beside `SKILL.md`.

### Anthropic Claude Skills

Use manual adaptation unless the host supports multi-file skill folders directly. Use `SKILL.md` as the primary skill instruction. Keep `references/playbook.md` and `references/acceptance-tests.md` attached as supporting resources when possible.

### Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, And IDE Agents

Use manual adaptation. Attach `SKILL.md` as the task rule. Attach `references/playbook.md` for review or implementation work, and run helper scripts locally when file evidence is available.

### LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, And Custom Runtimes

Use manual adaptation. Treat this folder as a specialist-agent role pack. Expose scripts in `scripts/` as local tools and route results through the standard output contract.

### Data Providers And Platforms

Use local exports or metadata from Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, dbt, Dagster, MLflow, DVC, W&B, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, or local files. Do not upload private data to external providers unless the user explicitly approves that environment.

## Included Files

- `SKILL.md`: trigger metadata and core workflow.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: OpenAI UI metadata and invocation defaults.
- `.gitignore`: keeps Python bytecode caches and local OS files out of PR payloads.
- `references/playbook.md`: checklist, decision rules, red flags, and evidence discipline.
- `references/acceptance-tests.md`: clean, messy, and adversarial forward tests.
- `references/evidence-map.md`: public evidence and non-duplication rationale.
- `references/infographic-spec.md`: Reddit visual brief.
- `references/provider-interop.md`: provider and agent usage guide.
- `scripts/`: deterministic local helper scripts.
- `assets/hero-shot.png`: wide hero image for PRs and docs.
- `assets/reddit-infographic.png`: 1080x1350 Reddit-ready infographic.

## Helper Scripts

Run scripts locally against explicit user-provided artifacts. They are support checks, not complete replacements for expert review.

- `scripts/quick_validate_skill.py .`: validate this standalone skill folder. Exit `0` means the package is structurally complete.
- `scripts/checklist_score.py checklist.json --strict`: score pass/partial/fail/blocker checklist JSON. Exit nonzero when strict mode finds anything below ready.
- `scripts/notebook_repro_audit.py analysis.ipynb`: flag out-of-order execution, local paths, shell commands, downloads, and unseeded randomness hints.

## Red Flags

- out-of-order execution
- local absolute paths
- unseeded randomness
- implicit data downloads
- manual cell edits required

## Validation

Run `python scripts/quick_validate_skill.py .` inside this folder. For script-backed checks, run the relevant script on local fixture data or user-provided artifacts. Validate the result against `references/acceptance-tests.md`.

## Completeness Checklist

- [x] Independent `SKILL.md` with specific trigger metadata.
- [x] README page with problem, use cases, inputs, workflow, outputs, provider guidance, and validation.
- [x] Provider and multi-agent interoperability guide.
- [x] Skill-specific playbook and acceptance tests.
- [x] Hero shot and Reddit infographic assets.
- [x] Local deterministic helper scripts where useful.
- [x] Explicit red flags and evidence discipline.
