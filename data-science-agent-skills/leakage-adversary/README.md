## Executive Summary

**Leakage Adversary** is a portable, provider-neutral data science agent skill designed to actively search ML datasets and pipelines for target, temporal, group, split, join, and preprocessing leakage.

> **Core pain solved:** Models look excellent offline and fail in production because future or target information leaked into training.

> **Proof callout:** Prevents fake accuracy from reaching production.

## Research-Informed Design Standard

This skill follows reproducible data science and portable agent-skill standards:

- **Cookiecutter Data Science**: immutable raw data, clear artifact layout, and repeatable command entrypoints.
- **Kedro**: explicit input/output data contracts and modular workflow boundaries.
- **MLflow**: traceable parameters, metrics, provenance hashes, and governance-ready evaluation records.
- **Anthropic & Open Agent Skills**: concise `SKILL.md` frontmatter, progressive disclosure via `references/`, and deterministic local scripts in `scripts/`.
- **CfRR Reproducible Research**: deterministic verification, explicit uncertainty, and zero hidden state.

## Problem It Solves

Models look excellent offline and fail in production because future or target information leaked into training. Without a structured gate, teams routinely discover `feature timestamp after target` or `same user in train and test` only after engineering effort or executive credibility has already been spent.

## What This Skill Should Do

- Transform a vague request into an explicit Leakage Adversary decision with named owner, evidence, assumptions, and action threshold.
- Inspect local artifacts first: data extracts, schemas, notebooks, SQL, pipeline configs, model reports, tickets, and prior decisions.
- Separate mechanical checks from expert judgment so another reviewer can reproduce what was checked and what was inferred.
- Classify findings as stop, fix-first, monitor, accepted risk, or owner decision instead of producing generic advice.
- Preserve raw evidence and never silently mutate data, notebooks, model artifacts, or production configs.
- Return a decision artifact that can be handed to a data scientist, ML engineer, governance reviewer, or stakeholder without hidden context.

## Required Inputs

- training data
- target definition
- split logic
- feature list
- pipeline code or notebook

## Operating Workflow

1. Restate what information is available at decision time.
2. Probe features, joins, encoders, aggregations, and preprocessing for post-outcome information.
3. Check split logic for temporal bleed, group overlap, duplicated entities, and near-duplicates.
4. Review suspiciously strong features and validation performance jumps.
5. Return leakage findings with severity, evidence, and safer split or feature alternatives.

## Expected Outputs

- leakage attack report
- feature risk table
- split risk table
- safe evaluation recommendation
- blocker list

All outputs are delivered inside the eight-section decision contract: `Problem`, `Inputs`, `Checks performed`, `Findings`, `Decision`, `Risks`, `Next actions`, and `Artifacts`.

## Concrete Use Cases

- **Pre-commit readiness gate**: Run `scripts/split_leakage_probe.py` on `training data` to produce a `leakage attack report` before approving engineering scope.
- **Adversarial review**: Challenge a proposed `go` recommendation when `feature timestamp after target` or `same user in train and test` is suspected in `target definition`.
- **Cross-team handoff**: Generate `feature risk table` and `blocker list` so ML engineers, governance reviewers, or downstream agents can act without re-running discovery.
- **Regression audit**: Score completed review checklists with `scripts/checklist_score.py --strict` inside CI to prevent unverified artifacts from shipping.

## Red Flags

- feature timestamp after target
- same user in train and test
- global preprocessing before split
- leaky aggregate
- near-perfect simple model
