## Summary

`production-ml-handoff` is an independent Agent/Codex skill for: Convert data science prototypes into engineering-ready ML handoffs with contracts, artifacts, SLOs, monitoring, and ownership.

It exists because Engineering teams receive notebooks and model files without enough interface, operational, or rollback detail. A handoff package prevents prototype ambiguity from becoming production fragility.

The skill is not a generic data-analysis helper. It is a judgment workflow: it tells the agent what evidence to gather, what checks to run, what assumptions to expose, and what decision-ready artifact to return.

## Problem It Solves

The current data science pain is not that there are no notebooks, dashboards, profilers, or MLOps tools. The pain is that teams still lose trust at the handoff points: unclear questions, weak data readiness, hidden leakage, missing provenance, fragile notebooks, vague ownership, and model work that cannot be defended.

This skill targets one of those gaps directly:

- Primary pain: Engineering teams receive notebooks and model files without enough interface, operational, or rollback detail.
- Why existing tools are not enough: tools can inspect fragments, but they rarely force the agent to connect evidence, owner decisions, risk, and next action in one repeatable workflow.
- What this skill adds: A handoff package prevents prototype ambiguity from becoming production fragility.

## What This Skill Should Do

- Convert the request into an explicit Production ML Handoff decision rather than a loose analysis task.
- List the evidence used, the evidence missing, and the assumptions that are driving the recommendation.
- Run the skill workflow against local artifacts when available: prototype repo or notebook, model artifact, feature inputs, serving pattern.
- Separate mechanical checks from judgment calls so another reviewer can audit the result.
- Return a decision-ready artifact with risks, owner questions, and the smallest next action.
- Refuse to hide uncertainty. Mark unknown, not applicable, and needs human owner review as separate states.

## Required Inputs

- prototype repo or notebook
- model artifact
- feature inputs
- serving pattern
- SLOs
- owners
- monitoring needs

If an input is missing, the agent should inspect local files, schemas, notebooks, configs, or reports first. It should ask the user only for information that cannot be recovered and would materially change the decision.

## Operating Workflow

1. Define inference contract: inputs, outputs, types, thresholds, errors, latency, and privacy constraints.
2. Package artifacts, versioning, environment, and reproducibility evidence.
3. Specify deployment path, rollback, monitoring, alerting, and ownership.
4. Identify engineering blockers and unresolved research assumptions.
5. Return a handoff brief and acceptance checklist.

## Expected Outputs

- API or batch contract
- artifact manifest
- SLO and monitoring plan
- rollback plan
- handoff acceptance checklist

Every final answer produced with this skill should use this output contract:

- `Problem`: the decision, artifact, model, data source, or workflow being handled.
- `Inputs`: files, data, stakeholder context, assumptions, and missing context used.
- `Checks performed`: concrete inspections, scripts, and reasoning checks.
- `Findings`: prioritized observations with evidence.
- `Decision`: go, fix-first, stop, proceed-with-risk, or needs-owner-review.
- `Risks`: unresolved blockers, caveats, and owner decisions.
- `Next actions`: the smallest useful follow-up steps.
- `Artifacts`: generated files, specs, scripts, reports, or links.

## Concrete Use Cases

- Before a project starts: decide whether to proceed with production ML handoff work or fix prerequisites first.
- During review: challenge the work when a red flag appears, such as notebook is only artifact.
- Before handoff: package the findings so another agent, data scientist, engineer, or stakeholder can act without rereading the whole investigation.

## Red Flags

- notebook is only artifact
- feature definitions ambiguous
- no rollback plan
- latency unknown
- owner unclear after launch

When one of these appears, the skill should slow down, preserve evidence, and name the risk in the final decision. A red flag does not always mean stop, but it must be visible.

## How To Use With OpenAI Agents

Copy this whole folder into the configured skills directory. Invoke it with `$production-ml-handoff` or let the frontmatter description trigger it. Keep `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` beside `SKILL.md`.

For Codex, use it when the task involves local evidence, file inspection, validation, implementation planning, or PR-ready artifacts. The helper scripts should run only against local files or explicit user-provided data.

## How To Use With Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, LangGraph, CrewAI, Or AutoGen

Use `SKILL.md` as the role instruction for a specialist agent. Attach `references/playbook.md` for the checklist, `references/acceptance-tests.md` for forward tests, and `references/provider-interop.md` for provider-specific adaptation.

For multi-agent systems, route this skill as a specialist reviewer. It should receive evidence from collector agents, run local scripts where available, then return a decision artifact rather than unstructured advice.

## Data Providers And Platforms

Use exported metadata, schemas, samples, logs, lineage files, model cards, metric reports, or experiment records from Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, dbt, Dagster, MLflow, DVC, W&B, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, or local files.

Do not upload private data to external providers unless the user explicitly approves that environment. Provider output is evidence, not authority.

## Included Files

- `SKILL.md`: trigger metadata and core execution workflow.
- `README.md`: this independent GitHub skill page.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: OpenAI-facing metadata and invocation defaults.
- `.gitignore`: local noise filter for this skill.
- `references/playbook.md`: skill-specific checklist, decisions, red flags, and evidence discipline.
- `references/acceptance-tests.md`: clean, messy, and adversarial forward tests.
- `references/evidence-map.md`: public evidence and non-duplication rationale.
- `references/infographic-spec.md`: social visual brief.
- `references/provider-interop.md`: provider and agent usage guide.
- `scripts/`: deterministic local helper scripts where this skill benefits from checks.
- `assets/hero-shot.png`: 1600x900 hero image.
- `assets/reddit-infographic.png`: 1080x1350 Reddit-ready infographic.

## Validation

Run `python scripts/quick_validate_skill.py .` inside this folder. For script-backed skills, run the relevant helper script on a tiny local fixture and one messy example.

Before merging or installing the skill, verify:

- The README renders both images at the top.
- `SKILL.md` has the correct trigger name and output contract.
- The helper scripts return clear errors for missing or invalid inputs.
- The skill does not silently mutate raw data.
- The final response names assumptions and next actions.
