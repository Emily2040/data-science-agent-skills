## Executive Summary

**Model Risk Compliance Memo** is a portable, provider-neutral data science agent skill designed to create concise model risk and compliance memos for review, audit, launch, or executive approval.

> **Core pain solved:** Data science teams often lack a crisp artifact that explains model purpose, risk, evidence, limits, and controls.

> **Proof callout:** Makes launch risk review faster and clearer.

## Research-Informed Design Standard

This skill follows reproducible data science and portable agent-skill standards:

- **Cookiecutter Data Science**: immutable raw data, clear artifact layout, and repeatable command entrypoints.
- **Kedro**: explicit input/output data contracts and modular workflow boundaries.
- **MLflow**: traceable parameters, metrics, provenance hashes, and governance-ready evaluation records.
- **Anthropic & Open Agent Skills**: concise `SKILL.md` frontmatter, progressive disclosure via `references/`, and deterministic local scripts in `scripts/`.
- **CfRR Reproducible Research**: deterministic verification, explicit uncertainty, and zero hidden state.

## Problem It Solves

Data science teams often lack a crisp artifact that explains model purpose, risk, evidence, limits, and controls. Without a structured gate, teams routinely discover `affected users undefined` or `no rollback owner` only after engineering effort or executive credibility has already been spent.

## What This Skill Should Do

- Transform a vague request into an explicit Model Risk Compliance Memo decision with named owner, evidence, assumptions, and action threshold.
- Inspect local artifacts first: data extracts, schemas, notebooks, SQL, pipeline configs, model reports, tickets, and prior decisions.
- Separate mechanical checks from expert judgment so another reviewer can reproduce what was checked and what was inferred.
- Classify findings as stop, fix-first, monitor, accepted risk, or owner decision instead of producing generic advice.
- Preserve raw evidence and never silently mutate data, notebooks, model artifacts, or production configs.
- Return a decision artifact that can be handed to a data scientist, ML engineer, governance reviewer, or stakeholder without hidden context.

## Required Inputs

- model purpose
- data sources
- users affected
- evaluation evidence
- privacy and fairness concerns
- monitoring plan

## Operating Workflow

1. Define model purpose, non-goals, user impact, and decision authority.
2. Summarize data, training, evaluation, fairness, privacy, explainability, and limitations.
3. Classify risks by severity, likelihood, detectability, and owner.
4. Document controls, monitoring, rollback, and approval conditions.
5. Return a memo with open blockers and required signoffs.

## Expected Outputs

- model risk memo
- risk register
- control map
- approval conditions
- signoff checklist

All outputs are delivered inside the eight-section decision contract: `Problem`, `Inputs`, `Checks performed`, `Findings`, `Decision`, `Risks`, `Next actions`, and `Artifacts`.

## Concrete Use Cases

- **Pre-commit readiness gate**: Run `scripts/risk_tier_gate.py` on `model purpose` to produce a `model risk memo` before approving engineering scope.
- **Adversarial review**: Challenge a proposed `go` recommendation when `affected users undefined` or `no rollback owner` is suspected in `data sources`.
- **Cross-team handoff**: Generate `risk register` and `signoff checklist` so ML engineers, governance reviewers, or downstream agents can act without re-running discovery.
- **Regression audit**: Score completed review checklists with `scripts/checklist_score.py --strict` inside CI to prevent unverified artifacts from shipping.

## Red Flags

- affected users undefined
- no rollback owner
- fairness not evaluated where relevant
- privacy basis unclear
- monitoring absent

## Agent And Provider Portability

- **Agent Runtimes**: OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT Agents, Anthropic Claude, Claude Code, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Goose, OpenCode, OpenHands, Gravity, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, and local LLM agents.
- **Data & ML Providers**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, dbt, Dagster, Airflow, Prefect, MLflow, DVC, Weights & Biases, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, Great Expectations, Pandera, Evidently, Kedro, and local CSV/Parquet/JSON files.
