## Executive Summary

**Causal Assumption Scout** is a portable, provider-neutral data science agent skill designed to clarify when a data science request needs causal reasoning, what assumptions are required, and what evidence is missing.

> **Core pain solved:** Teams overclaim causal impact from observational models, dashboards, or correlations.

> **Proof callout:** Keeps impact claims honest.

## Research-Informed Design Standard

This skill follows reproducible data science and portable agent-skill standards:

- **Cookiecutter Data Science**: immutable raw data, clear artifact layout, and repeatable command entrypoints.
- **Kedro**: explicit input/output data contracts and modular workflow boundaries.
- **MLflow**: traceable parameters, metrics, provenance hashes, and governance-ready evaluation records.
- **Anthropic & Open Agent Skills**: concise `SKILL.md` frontmatter, progressive disclosure via `references/`, and deterministic local scripts in `scripts/`.
- **CfRR Reproducible Research**: deterministic verification, explicit uncertainty, and zero hidden state.

## Problem It Solves

Teams overclaim causal impact from observational models, dashboards, or correlations. Without a structured gate, teams routinely discover `no intervention` or `post-treatment controls` only after engineering effort or executive credibility has already been spent.

## What This Skill Should Do

- Transform a vague request into an explicit Causal Assumption Scout decision with named owner, evidence, assumptions, and action threshold.
- Inspect local artifacts first: data extracts, schemas, notebooks, SQL, pipeline configs, model reports, tickets, and prior decisions.
- Separate mechanical checks from expert judgment so another reviewer can reproduce what was checked and what was inferred.
- Classify findings as stop, fix-first, monitor, accepted risk, or owner decision instead of producing generic advice.
- Preserve raw evidence and never silently mutate data, notebooks, model artifacts, or production configs.
- Return a decision artifact that can be handed to a data scientist, ML engineer, governance reviewer, or stakeholder without hidden context.

## Required Inputs

- proposed claim
- treatment or intervention
- outcome
- population
- available covariates
- study design

## Operating Workflow

1. Rewrite the claim as prediction, association, or causal effect.
2. Define treatment, outcome, population, time window, and estimand.
3. Draft a DAG-level assumption map and confounder inventory.
4. Recommend experiment, quasi-experiment, matching, weighting, regression, or do-not-claim-causality.
5. Return language that is safe for stakeholders and a sensitivity plan.

## Expected Outputs

- causal claim rewrite
- assumption map
- confounder checklist
- method recommendation
- safe-language memo

All outputs are delivered inside the eight-section decision contract: `Problem`, `Inputs`, `Checks performed`, `Findings`, `Decision`, `Risks`, `Next actions`, and `Artifacts`.

## Concrete Use Cases

- **Pre-commit readiness gate**: Run `scripts/confounder_backdoor_check.py` on `proposed claim` to produce a `causal claim rewrite` before approving engineering scope.
- **Adversarial review**: Challenge a proposed `go` recommendation when `no intervention` or `post-treatment controls` is suspected in `treatment or intervention`.
- **Cross-team handoff**: Generate `assumption map` and `safe-language memo` so ML engineers, governance reviewers, or downstream agents can act without re-running discovery.
- **Regression audit**: Score completed review checklists with `scripts/checklist_score.py --strict` inside CI to prevent unverified artifacts from shipping.

## Red Flags

- no intervention
- post-treatment controls
- selection bias
- unmeasured confounders
- effect framed after seeing results
